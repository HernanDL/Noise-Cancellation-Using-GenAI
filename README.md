# TCN-based Urban Noise Prediction and Cancellation

## Overview
This repository implements a **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** for predicting and canceling urban noise through phase inversion. It is designed to handle complex noise patterns typically found in urban environments, such as machinery, engines, and constant background hums. By predicting the inverted phase of the noise, the model can effectively reduce or cancel out unwanted sounds when combined with the original input.

## Introduction
Urban noise spans a wide frequency range, from **20 Hz** (low hums) to **20,000 Hz** (high-pitched whines). Traditional noise cancellation methods like simple filters may struggle with these diverse patterns. This project aims to address this by using a **machine learning approach** to predict the inverted phase of noise, enabling effective cancellation of complex audio patterns.

The repository contains:
- A **TCN model** for time-series prediction of urban noise.
- Functions to **generate synthetic urban noise** for training.
- Scripts for **training, evaluating, and visualizing** model predictions.
- Code to **test the model** on real-world audio samples uploaded as WAV files.

## How Noise Cancellation Works
Noise cancellation is achieved through **phase inversion**:
1. **Phase Inversion**: For a given sound wave, an inverted phase is created. For example, if the original wave has a peak at a particular moment, the inverted wave has a trough at the same moment.
2. **Summation for Cancellation**: By adding the inverted wave to the original wave, the positive and negative peaks cancel each other out, leading to a reduction or cancellation of the sound.
3. **Learning the Inversion**: Instead of manually inverting, a machine learning model like a TCN learns to predict the inverse of complex noise patterns, adapting to various types of noise automatically.

This project uses synthetic urban noise for training the TCN, allowing the model to generalize well to various noise patterns.

## Why Use a TCN?
### Advantages of Temporal Convolutional Networks:
- **Long-range Temporal Dependencies**: TCNs use **dilated convolutions**, which allow them to capture dependencies over long time spans, making them suitable for audio signal prediction.
- **Faster Training**: Unlike recurrent models (e.g., LSTM or GRU), TCNs use convolutions, which can leverage parallel processing, leading to faster training times.
- **Stable Predictions**: TCNs avoid issues like vanishing or exploding gradients, common in RNNs, making them more stable for longer sequences.
- **Flexibility with Sequence Length**: TCNs can be designed to focus on a specific range of past samples, making them adaptable for different time-series tasks, such as audio signals.

### Why Not CNNs or GANs?
- **CNNs**: While CNNs are good at extracting features from local time windows, they often struggle with long-range dependencies, which are crucial for modeling the temporal structure of noise.
- **GANs**: Generative Adversarial Networks can be powerful for generating new samples but may be more complex and slower to train when it comes to learning the nuances of phase inversion.

In this scenario, the TCN strikes a balance between speed, simplicity, and its ability to adapt to the complex structure of urban noise.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or above
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for interactive execution

### Required Libraries
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow librosa
```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TCN-urban-noise-cancellation.git
cd TCN-urban-noise-cancellation
```

## Usage
1. **Training the Model**: Use the provided notebook to train the TCN model on synthetic noise. Adjust parameters like `sequence_length`, `sample_rate`, and `max_freq` to match your data.
2. **Testing the Model**: Upload a real-world WAV file to test the model's noise cancellation performance.
3. **Visualization**: The notebook includes plots for the input waveform, predicted waveform, combined waveform, and residual noise in dB.

### Training the Model
```python
predictor = WaveformPredictor()
history = predictor.train()
```

### Testing with a Real WAV File
1. Upload a WAV file in the Colab environment.
2. Use the following code to load the file and make predictions:
```python
uploaded = files.upload()
file_name = list(uploaded.keys())[0]
waveform, _ = librosa.load(file_name, sr=predictor.sample_rate)
predicted_waveform = predictor.predict(waveform)
combined_waveform = waveform[predictor.sequence_length:] + predicted_waveform
predictor.plot_results(waveform, predicted_waveform, combined_waveform)
```

## Results
The results are visualized through plots:
- **Input Waveform**: Visualizes the original urban noise.
- **Predicted Waveform**: Shows the inverted phase predicted by the TCN.
- **Combined Waveform**: Illustrates the outcome when the input is added to its inverted phase, highlighting the cancellation effect.
- **Residual Noise (dB)**: Plots the residual noise in decibels, indicating the effectiveness of the noise cancellation.

The effectiveness of the TCN model can vary depending on factors such as sequence length, noise complexity, and training data diversity.


## Future Steps
#### 1. Implementing Real-time Predictions
To extend the current noise cancellation approach for **real-time predictions** and anti-noise generation, the following steps are proposed:

- **Stream Processing**: 
  - Use libraries like **PyAudio** or **SoundDevice** for real-time audio streaming.
  - Continuously capture small audio frames (e.g., 50 ms chunks).
  - Pre-process each frame and use the trained TCN model to predict the inverted phase in real-time.
  
- **Low-latency Model Optimization**: 
  - Use techniques like **model quantization** and **TensorFlow Lite** to reduce the model's size and speed up inference.
  - Convert the trained model into a **TensorFlow Lite** model for use on mobile devices or embedded systems.
  
- **On-device Inference**: 
  - Perform inference directly on an edge device (e.g., a smartphone or Raspberry Pi) to minimize the latency associated with sending data back and forth between the device and a server.
  - Implement efficient buffering mechanisms to handle overlapping audio frames for smooth transitions between predictions.
  
- **Feedback Loop for Adjustment**: 
  - Integrate a feedback loop that adjusts the phase prediction based on real-time error measurements (i.e., residual noise that remains after cancellation).
  - Use this feedback to fine-tune the prediction model on-the-fly, optimizing it for the specific noise environment.

#### 2. Real-time Anti-noise Generation
To produce real-time anti-noise, the following approach can be taken:

- **Audio Output Synchronization**: 
  - Ensure that the predicted anti-noise signal is output with minimal latency, synchronized with the incoming audio.
  - Use libraries like **PortAudio** to handle low-latency audio playback, ensuring that the anti-noise signal is played in sync with the input noise.

- **Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC)**:
  - Implement an adaptive filter, such as a **LMS (Least Mean Squares)** or **RLS (Recursive Least Squares)** filter, to refine the output in real-time.
  - The adaptive filter can be trained to further reduce any residual noise that remains after the TCN-based inversion.

- **Streaming Model Update**: 
  - Use a **streaming TCN** implementation that can update its weights based on incoming data without needing full retraining.
  - This will allow the model to adapt to changes in the noise environment as they occur, making it more effective for dynamic conditions.

### Phone App Proposal
To create a phone application capable of recording noise, analyzing it, and generating anti-noise in real-time, consider the following components and architecture:

#### 1. App Functionality Overview
- **Noise Recording**: 
  - Use the phone's microphone to record a short sample of the ambient noise.
  - Pre-process the audio for model inference (normalize and extract features).
  
- **Noise Analysis**: 
  - Run a **pre-trained TCN model** or a lighter version of the model on the phone to analyze the recorded noise sample.
  - Provide an option to view the waveform and frequency spectrum of the noise.

- **Anti-noise Generation**: 
  - Use the model's output to create a phase-inverted signal.
  - Play the inverted signal through the phone's speakers to cancel out the noise.
  - Continuously monitor the environment for changes in noise and adjust the anti-noise output dynamically.

#### 2. Technical Architecture
- **Front-end (UI/UX)**:
  - Build a **React Native** or **Flutter** application for cross-platform support (Android & iOS).
  - Create an intuitive interface with features such as a real-time spectrogram, start/stop recording buttons, and noise cancellation indicators.
  
- **Model Inference (On-device)**:
  - Convert the TCN model to **TensorFlow Lite** and integrate it into the app.
  - Use libraries like **TFLite Interpreter** to perform real-time predictions on audio input.
  - Store the pre-trained model locally on the device for offline functionality.

- **Real-time Audio Processing**:
  - Use **AudioRecord** (Android) or **AVAudioEngine** (iOS) for capturing real-time audio streams.
  - Use **PortAudio** for low-latency audio playback to output the generated anti-noise signal.
  - Implement a circular buffer to manage real-time audio input and prediction output.

#### 3. Additional Features
- **Auto-calibration**: 
  - Allow the app to perform an initial calibration in different noise environments, adjusting the model’s prediction parameters for better performance.
  
- **Noise History and Analysis**: 
  - Store audio samples for later analysis and track the app's performance over time.
  - Visualize changes in noise levels using graphs and dB readings.

- **Cloud Backup & Training**:
  - Provide an option to upload noise samples to the cloud for further model training.
  - Use the collected data to improve the TCN model over time with additional training on a server-side infrastructure.

#### 4. Challenges and Considerations
- **Latency**: The biggest challenge in implementing real-time noise cancellation is maintaining extremely low latency between recording and playback.
- **Battery Consumption**: Real-time audio processing is power-intensive. Efficient audio streaming and model inference are critical for maintaining battery life.
- **Speaker-Microphone Distance**: The effectiveness of the phase inversion method depends on the relative distance between the phone's speakers and microphone, as it impacts how the anti-noise and original noise combine.

### Summary
This repository provides a foundation for implementing noise cancellation using phase inversion with a TCN model. With future steps focusing on real-time predictions and on-device capabilities, the solution can evolve into a practical, real-world application. The proposed mobile app could empower users to minimize unwanted noise using their smartphones, adapting dynamically to various noise environments.
