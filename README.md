# TCN-based Urban Noise Prediction and Cancellation

## Overview
This repository implements a **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)** for predicting and canceling urban noise through phase inversion. It is designed to handle complex noise patterns typically found in urban environments, such as machinery, engines, and constant background hums. By predicting the inverted phase of the noise, the model can effectively reduce or cancel out unwanted sounds when combined with the original input.

## Introduction
Urban noise spans a wide frequency range, from **20 Hz** (low hums) to **20,000 Hz** (high-pitched whines). Traditional noise cancellation methods like simple filters may struggle with these diverse patterns. This project aims to address this by using a **machine learning approach** to predict the inverted phase of noise, enabling effective cancellation of complex audio patterns.

The repository contains:
- A **TCN model** for time-series prediction of urban noise.
- Functions to **generate synthetic urban noise** for training.
- Scripts for **training, evaluating, and visualizing** model predictions.
- Code to **test the model** on real-world audio samples uploaded as WAV files.

## How Noise Cancellation Works
Noise cancellation is achieved through **phase inversion**:
1. **Phase Inversion**: For a given sound wave, an inverted phase is created. For example, if the original wave has a peak at a particular moment, the inverted wave has a trough at the same moment.
2. **Summation for Cancellation**: By adding the inverted wave to the original wave, the positive and negative peaks cancel each other out, leading to a reduction or cancellation of the sound.
3. **Learning the Inversion**: Instead of manually inverting, a machine learning model like a TCN learns to predict the inverse of complex noise patterns, adapting to various types of noise automatically.

This project uses synthetic urban noise for training the TCN, allowing the model to generalize well to various noise patterns.

## Why Use a TCN?
### Advantages of Temporal Convolutional Networks:
- **Long-range Temporal Dependencies**: TCNs use **dilated convolutions**, which allow them to capture dependencies over long time spans, making them suitable for audio signal prediction.
- **Faster Training**: Unlike recurrent models (e.g., LSTM or GRU), TCNs use convolutions, which can leverage parallel processing, leading to faster training times.
- **Stable Predictions**: TCNs avoid issues like vanishing or exploding gradients, common in RNNs, making them more stable for longer sequences.
- **Flexibility with Sequence Length**: TCNs can be designed to focus on a specific range of past samples, making them adaptable for different time-series tasks, such as audio signals.

### Why Not CNNs or GANs?
- **CNNs**: While CNNs are good at extracting features from local time windows, they often struggle with long-range dependencies, which are crucial for modeling the temporal structure of noise.
- **GANs**: Generative Adversarial Networks can be powerful for generating new samples but may be more complex and slower to train when it comes to learning the nuances of phase inversion.

In this scenario, the TCN strikes a balance between speed, simplicity, and its ability to adapt to the complex structure of urban noise.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or above
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for interactive execution

### Required Libraries
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow librosa
```

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TCN-urban-noise-cancellation.git
cd TCN-urban-noise-cancellation
```

## Usage
1. **Training the Model**: Use the provided notebook to train the TCN model on synthetic noise. Adjust parameters like `sequence_length`, `sample_rate`, and `max_freq` to match your data.
2. **Testing the Model**: Upload a real-world WAV file to test the model's noise cancellation performance.
3. **Visualization**: The notebook includes plots for the input waveform, predicted waveform, combined waveform, and residual noise in dB.

### Training the Model
```python
predictor = WaveformPredictor()
history = predictor.train()
```

### Testing with a Real WAV File
1. Upload a WAV file in the Colab environment.
2. Use the following code to load the file and make predictions:
```python
uploaded = files.upload()
file_name = list(uploaded.keys())[0]
waveform, _ = librosa.load(file_name, sr=predictor.sample_rate)
predicted_waveform = predictor.predict(waveform)
combined_waveform = waveform[predictor.sequence_length:] + predicted_waveform
predictor.plot_results(waveform, predicted_waveform, combined_waveform)
```

## Results
The results are visualized through plots:
- **Input Waveform**: Visualizes the original urban noise.
- **Predicted Waveform**: Shows the inverted phase predicted by the TCN.
- **Combined Waveform**: Illustrates the outcome when the input is added to its inverted phase, highlighting the cancellation effect.
- **Residual Noise (dB)**: Plots the residual noise in decibels, indicating the effectiveness of the noise cancellation.

The effectiveness of the TCN model can vary depending on factors such as sequence length, noise complexity, and training data diversity.
